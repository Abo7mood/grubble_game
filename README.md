## Story of this game 📚
--------------------------

This game was a **solo project** I created to explore the mechanics of endless runners in a **web-based** environment. The idea was to develop a game that was easily accessible, fun, and challenging for players of all skill levels.

The process started with building the core movement mechanics and refining the physics to ensure smooth gameplay. Adding **multiple levels** and a **high-score system** gave players a reason to keep pushing their limits. The WebGL format allowed the game to be played instantly without the need for downloads or installations.

Developing this project was both a technical and creative journey, allowing me to improve my **game design skills** while ensuring a polished and engaging experience for players. It remains one of my favorite experiments in web game development!
